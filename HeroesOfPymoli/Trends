Three observable trends based on the data

1)There is a significant higher percentage of male identifying players than female or undisclosed. However, each group spends a very similar average amount of money
  on these items. These means that all three groups are worth focusing on to continue items sales.
2) A large portion of the players are between the ages of 15-29. These players also spend the most money on items. This would be a good age group to focus on
  for continued items sales.
3) The items that made the most money are very similar to the items that were sold most often. This may seem obvious, buy many of the items vary in price greatly.
  This shows that even the more expensive items are still purchased at a similar rate.
